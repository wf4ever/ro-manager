The GWAS and metabolomics experiments were done by others than Kristina. She makes a note of the origin ..."

"UB21","re-user","to adapt existing workflows for a new study","I can benefit from the knowledge and previous work of colleagues","","","KH [1]","Kristina is new to workflows, so she wishes to start with an existing workflow. When she started on the project she was introduced to people that perform related work. She knows that one of her colleagues is making a workflow for the mapping of SNPs to genes, and then onto pathways. She also knows that another colleague has created an abstract workflow for parts of the text mining technology that she wants to use."

"UB23","re-user","to build a new workflow from more than one existing workflow","I can benefit from the knowledge and previous work of colleagues","","","KH [1]","She decides that she would like to build a workflow that would integrate the text mining technology with the one already implemented for the SNP-gene-pathway pipeline."
"UB24","re-user","to record an abstract (not-yet-implemented) workflow","I can explain my needs to colleagues who will implement processes I shall need","","","KH [1]","However, the abstract workflow for the text mining technology will probably take a long time to implement since the underlying web services that are needed do not actually exist yet. She is dependent on another colleague to implement these for her. At this point she decides to make an abstract workflow of her own, that she will use as a reference when explaining her research and analysis steps."
"UB25","re-user","to run a workflow with an alternative processing tool ...OR... to partially execute a workflow, with unavailable sections replaced by manual processes ?????","I can make progress in my research while waiting for processing tools or other workflows to be implemented","","","KH [1]","This tool is however in need of an update, which she will perform. In the mean time, the ordering customer, which is the scientist that provided the original data, is getting impatient and wants results. She therefore decides to run the analysis with the version of the tool that is available. She uses the output from the already available SNP-gene-pathway workflow to map SNPs to genes, ending up with a list of genes for a metabolite. This lists she feeds into the tool."
"UB26","re-user","to record information that is discovered from other external sources","I can keep track of reasons for decisions made in the conduct of my studies","","","KH [1]","Ultimately, the workflow (or at this point the tool that is actually available) suggests for example that one gene in the set of genes associated with a specific metabolite actually is associated with the metabolite via the Gluconeogenesis biological process. It is one of the two main mechanisms humans and many other animals use to keep blood glucose levels from dropping too low (hypoglycemia), information he finds on the Internet. She makes a note of that and goes back to the tool to see if Gluconeogenesis is a process that is known to be associated with MetS."
"UB27","re-user","to repeatedly re-run a workflow with different input parameters and/or data","I can look for potential links between my results and other known biological mechanisms","","","KH [1]","She will perform the same type of analysis for the different genes associated with the metabolite, and also for the list of genes as a whole. These analyses will lead to a number of candidate biological processes hypothesized to explain the gene-metabolite associations."

"UB30","re-user","link workflow results to previous results, procedures and hypotheses","I can subsequently retrieve information about the relationship between hypotheses and results obtained","","","KH [1]","In this case she will link the result from this workflow to the previous experiment and in particular to the initial hypothesis. At some point, she wishes to be able to retrieve this past information and the interrelationships among his hypotheses."
"UB31","re-user","Extract information from a working RO for publication","I can easily use my working notes as a basis for creating the distilled information needed for publication.","","","KH [1]","Assuming her finding and new hypotheses are valuable and new, she will publish her results. The publication has cleaned information, sufficient for evaluating her hypothesis and rerunning the one workflow and the one dataset that lead to this result."

"UB33","investigator","archive submission of genetic variants that are part of a paper to suggest a standard encoding of genetic variants","the papers mentioning a genetic variant can be semantically linked to each other, and to database records","","","MR [2]","For comparison: when genetic variants are submitted to an archive and as part of a paper, we can suggest the proper encoding for genetic variants (this is non-trivial). This semantically links the papers mentioning the variant to one another and to any database using the same encoding for variants."
"UB34","investigator","archive submission of a workflow to be matched with the [prevailing? experiment?] Research Object model, requiring a user to correct mismatches and resolve ambiguities","(common format elements facilitate subsequent processing?)","","","MR [2]","For workflows I imagine that submission would be the moment of matching a workflow with the RO model. When mismatches occur, we can ask the user to disambiguate or add missing information."

The process is facilitated by publishing the RO model."

In my vision, the notebook creates the archive (or prepares for archival). Every submission of an artefact+notes comes with storing provenance information, that a user can later use to look up information before publishing. So for instance, when a workflow produces an output that we wish to keep, we don't have to worry about its timestamp and metadata remaining linked to it."

"UB37","author","assistance in generating a publication RO from a living RO by matching living and publication RO models","the process of preparing a publication object is facilitated","","","MR [2]","This may be facilitated by matching to the potential difference that may exist in the RO model instance of the 'living' and 'published' ROs. It can guide in what to remove (e.g. intermediate datasets),"
"UB38","author","enforcement of minimum requirements for a publication RO to be enforced.","(adherence to community standards for publication is maintained)","","","MR [2]","and it may be more strict about which information should minimally be provided, similar to the strict requirements for publications"
"UB39","investigator, author","RO submission to suggest/encourage provision of information that will later be needed for publication","subsequent publication of the results of an investigation is made easier","","","MR [2]","(In practice this is the time where as user you feel sorry that you didn't provide this information to the living object earlier.)
Taking E's case as an example. She is producing a workflow from the compendium of R scripts that she used to explore the effect of so-called CpG islands (specific sequences often found in front of genes; their locations taken from an on line data source) on the change of gene expression in brain regions affected by Huntington's Disease. She has done several analyses for different kind of statistical plots (we assume these are in the living RO4), and now wishes to fix the workflow (in Taverna) and select the results for publication."
"UB40","investigator","tools to use standard formats for representing underlying experimental data and models","interoperability between systems and users is facilitated","","","MR [2]","Note: within our department we are developing a tool for generating interfaces for command line tools; the underlying model is in RDF. For each tool (e.g. Galaxy tools) a mapping is made in a template language. This is a bottleneck, but the RDF part facilitates interoperability."
"UB41","investigator","captured information to conform to standard semantic “study framework” models","??","","","MR [2]","It may be worthwhile to align with Study Capture frameworks here. I suggest to try to use the same semantic models under the hood as much as possible."
"UB42","investigator","working ROs to be presented and managed as a personal workspace","I can work privately with my notes and intermediate results until I am confident of having some result worth sharing","","","MR [2]","It may help if living RO's seem entirely personal, until a user is ready to share. Eleni is a typical PhD student/scientist; feeling uncomfortable sharing until she is entirely confident about the result. NB, following the wet-lab analogy this is not acceptable; notebooks are in principle property of the department and open to it (in practice this is not nastily adhered to though)"
