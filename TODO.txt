Priorities from Kristina:

I think such a tool would form a great starting point! As a start I would be happy with the following (by order of importance):

    * ro config: configure research object management tool
    * ro create: create new research object
    * ro add: add files to a research object
    * ro ls: list contents of research object
    * ro annotate, ro annotations: annotate research object contents
    * ro users: sharing research objects

which corresponds very well with your proposal of which functions to tackle initially. The only thing I miss is the sharing part. I think that is something I would like to be able to do quite fast as well. One thing I thought about was logging. Would it be possible to create a log? That would help me backtrack what I actually do with a RO, and in which order I tend to do things.

TODO:

* ro eval checklist
** Support for <forall>... <exists>... rule structures
** See: http://www.wf4ever-project.org/wiki/display/docs/Integrity+and+Authenticity+component
** See: https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/26123933
** Test that aggregated files actually exist - part of liveness?
** Target specification is very error prone
** Error handling when target not found is poor

* Refactor sync code to use ro_metadata to access manifest (OUTSTANDING)

* Refactor ro_metadata to handle manifest access and updates locally, rather than via ro_annotations.
  Also, add logic to cache ro_annotation graph.
  (Keep ro_annotations for annotation support methods)

* ro annotate/annnotations
** Test display of annotations for entire RO
** Test annotations shown in RO listing
** Test interactive/multiline update (how?)
** Test use of CURIE as type
** Test use of URI as type

* ro show config
* ro create should fail if RO already created

* option to change ro manifest aggregation details - ro modify?

* ro link
* ro links
* ro users
* ro create: create manifest file via rdflib serialization
* Options to return JSON/RDF info for use by other apps?
* Options for RO logging of changes, etc
* ro list currently shows only files: want to show directories too?

Other functions:
- display serialization of manifest graph
- display serialization of annotation graph
- read RO from web server

Technical debt:
- Mop up @@TODOs
- Clean up handling command analysis; factor out usage summaries
- When adding an annotation graph, check that it exists.  Also when displaying annotations.
- evaluation service should include minim description in result graph.
- See also SC47 page - http://www.wf4ever-project.org/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=3506198
- See also decay detection with checklist
- Include minim description in evaluation result (code changed; needs testing with online service)

DONE

* ro config: configure research object management tool
* ro create: create new research object
* ro status: display status of RO
* ro list / ro ls: list contents of research object
* ro annotate, ro annotations: annotate research object contents

* ro add [file]
* ro add [-a] [directory]
* ro eval completeness minim

* Refactor ro_manifest+ro_annotation to be a class creating a manifest object.  Revise code accordingly; don't depend on rodir from calling code.
** Define class ro_metadata that reads manifest and encapsulates both the graph and the base URI (done)
** Define relativization method that works with the new class (done)
** Modify ro_command functions to use new class for annotations, not ro_annotation module directly (done)
** Check that modified ro_command works with new RO (done)
** Create ro_metadata methods to replace direct references to ro_manifest functions (addAggregatedResources) (done)
** Remove direct references to ro_manifest in ro_command; use ro_metadata methods, in:
*** ro_command (done)
*** ro_eval_completeness (done)
*** BackgroundSync (recshceduled)
*** TestEvalCompleteness (done)
*** ro_metadata (done)
*** TestROMetadata (done)

* Refactor namespace definitions into separate module (from ro_manifest) (DONE)

* ro annotate (-g|--graph) rdf-resource [ file ] -- use RDF file already present as annotation for the named file.  Defaults to annotations for the entire RO.
